# M/L English Premier League Project

## A machine learning project that predicts English Premier League (EPL) match outcomes using historical match data and engineered features such as opponent strength, match timing, and venue

## Specific components were trained in order to rank precedence, which eventually determined the algorithms basis of prediction

# 🔍 Key Features

## 🧠 Utilized Beautiful Soup to retrieve and organize data into a formattable document

## 📊 Built with Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn in JupyterLab

## 🤖 Used a Random Forest Classifier to predict match outcomes

## 🎯 Achieved 91% precision and 81% accuracy through threshold tuning

## ⚙️ Feature engineering included time-based variables and opponent encoding
